# Bambi
As our societies become more urbanized, many deer are suffering the consequences. "Every year, there are about 1.5 million deer-related car accidents around the world, and deer accidents statistics show that theyâ€™re most common from October through December, which is the deer mating season," explains Petpedia, a reliable research facility. There are millions more which are separated from their homeland because of an intersecting road that has split their grounds.

There are some solutions such as overhead bridges, but they require the deer to take the difficult path. Instead, let's use the technology revolution to our advantage. Introducing... Bambi!

Bambi is an app that allows users to see where deer have been reported so they are cautious in those areas. They can also report deer themselves, allowing the society to become aware of our deer and decrease deer accidents!
